name: On new PR

# PROCESS
#
# 1. Fetch PR details previously saved from untrusted location
# 2. Parse details for safety
# 3. Confirm there is a related issue for newly opened PR
# 4. Verify if PR template is used and legal acknowledgement hasn't been removed

# USAGE
#
# NOTE: meant to be used with ./.github/workflows/record_pr.yml
#
# Security Note:
#
#   This workflow depends on "Record PR" workflow that runs in an untrusted location (forks) instead of `pull_request_target`.
#   This enforces zero trust where "Record PR" workflow always runs on fork with zero permissions on GH_TOKEN.
#   When "Record PR" completes, this workflow runs in our repository with the appropriate permissions and sanitize inputs.
#
#   Coupled with "Approve GitHub Action to run on forks", we have confidence no privilege can be escalated,
#   since any malicious change would need to be approved, and upon social engineering, it'll have zero permissions.
