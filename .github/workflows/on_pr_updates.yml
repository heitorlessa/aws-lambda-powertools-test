# Fail PR check if do-not-merge label is present
name: PR requirements

# PROCESS
#
# 1. Verify whether 'do-not-merge' label is present
# 2. Fail PR to prevent merging until resolved
# 3. Pass PR if do-not-merge label is removed by a maintainer

# USAGE
#
# Always triggered on PR labeling changes.

# NOTES
#
# PR requirements are checked async in on_opened_pr.yml and enforced here synchronously
# due to limitations in GH API.
